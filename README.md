# Console-based Contact Book App

*This project is part of a comprehensive 14-week Programming Fundamentals (PF) course, involving assignments and weekly labs.*

*As an assignment project, this Console-based Contact Book Application demonstrates key PF concepts in action.*

The Contact Book App efficiently manages contact information, allowing users to add, search, update, and delete contact records. The project utilizes a wide range of core Programming Fundamentals, including:

### Key Concepts Covered:

- **Variables and Data Types:** For storing contact details like names, phone numbers, and addresses.
- **Arithmetic Operators:** Used for logical operations within the program.
- **Loops and Conditional Statements:** To iterate over contact records and manage user input.
- **Functions:** For modularizing the code and making it easy to maintain.
- **Pointers and References:** For managing memory dynamically and passing data efficiently between functions.
- **Dynamic and Static Typing:** Implemented in variable management for more flexible and efficient code.
- **Comments:** To ensure code clarity and understanding.

The project consists of two main files: the first file utilizes `fstream` for file handling operations, and the second file demonstrates the simple use of dynamic arrays and pointers for efficient memory management.
